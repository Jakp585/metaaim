This is a plugin for the space combat MMORPG [Vendetta Online](http://vendetta-online.com).

Its purpose is to toggle the game's built-in autoaim feature based on the target's distance. It defaults to 80 meters with most weapons, but can be set to a different number with the /metaaim command. As an example, to set it to 100 meters, type /metaaim 100. It can be disabled with /metaaim off and turned back on with /metaaim on.

Newly added are the metaaiminc and metaaimdec commands, which add or subtract 10m from the distance and can be bound to keys for quick adjustments.
